## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @safe-global/safe-cli

# Or run without installing
npx @safe-global/safe-cli
```

### First-Time Setup

**1. Initialize configuration**
```bash
safe config init
```
This sets up your chain configurations and optional API keys.

**2. Import a wallet**
```bash
# Option A: Import from private key
safe wallet import

# Option B: Import Ledger hardware wallet (recommended)
safe wallet import-ledger
```
Private keys are encrypted with a password. Ledger wallets use your hardware device for signing.

**3. Create your first Safe**
```bash
safe account create
```
Follow the interactive prompts to configure owners and threshold.

**That's it!** You're ready to manage Safe accounts from your terminal.

## 🔐 Hardware Wallet Support

Safe CLI supports **Ledger hardware wallets** for enhanced security. Your private keys never leave the device.

### Prerequisites

1. **Ledger device** (Nano S, Nano S Plus, or Nano X)
2. **Ethereum app installed** on your Ledger
3. **Device firmware** up to date

### Importing a Ledger Wallet

```bash
safe wallet import-ledger
```

The CLI will guide you through:

1. **Device detection** - Connects to your Ledger automatically
2. **Derivation path selection** - Choose your address path:
   - **Ledger Live** (recommended): `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`
   - **Legacy MEW**: `m/44'/60'/0'/0` (for MyEtherWallet compatibility)
   - **Custom path**: Advanced users can specify their own BIP44 path
3. **Account index** - Select which account to use (0, 1, 2, etc.)
4. **Address verification** - Confirm the address matches your device screen
5. **Wallet naming** - Give your wallet a friendly name

**Example:**
```bash
$ safe wallet import-ledger

┌  Import Ledger Hardware Wallet
│
◇  Device detected!
│
◆  Select derivation path
│  ● Ledger Live (m/44'/60'/0'/0/0) - Default for Ledger Live (recommended)
│  ○ Legacy MEW (m/44'/60'/0'/0) - Compatible with MyEtherWallet/MyCrypto
│  ○ Custom path - Advanced: specify your own BIP44 path
└
◆  Enter account index
│  0
└
◇  Address: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
│  Derivation path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/0
│
◆  Does this address match what is shown on your Ledger device?
│  Yes
└
◆  Enter a name for this wallet
│  My Ledger
└
◇  Wallet imported successfully!
│  ID: a3f5e8c92d1b...
│  Address: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
│  Path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/0
│
└  Done!
```

### Using Your Ledger Wallet

Once imported, your Ledger wallet works seamlessly with all Safe CLI commands:

**Signing Transactions:**
```bash
safe tx sign

# The CLI automatically detects your Ledger wallet
# → Connecting to Ledger device...
# → Please confirm transaction on your Ledger device...
# → Transaction signed ✓
```

**Switching Wallets:**
```bash
safe wallet list  # Shows: 🔐 Ledger or 🔑 Private Key
safe wallet use   # Switch between wallets
```

### Multiple Ledger Accounts

You can import multiple accounts from the same Ledger:

```bash
# Import account 0
safe wallet import-ledger
# → Account index: 0
# → Name: "Ledger Account 0"

# Import account 1
safe wallet import-ledger
# → Account index: 1
# → Name: "Ledger Account 1"
```

Each account is tracked separately with its own derivation path.

### Troubleshooting

**"No Ledger device found"**
- Ensure device is connected via USB
- Unlock your Ledger
- Open the **Ethereum app** on the device

**"Failed to connect to Ledger"**
- Close Ledger Live (it locks the device)
- Try a different USB cable/port
- Update Ledger firmware to latest version

**"Transaction signing failed"**
- Make sure you approved the transaction on device
- Check that **Contract data** is enabled in Ethereum app settings
- Verify the device didn't time out (screen went dark)

**Contract Data Setting (Required for Safe):**
1. Open Ethereum app on Ledger
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Enable "Contract data"
4. Exit back to main Ethereum app

### Security Notes

✅ **What's stored locally:**
- Wallet address
- Derivation path
- Wallet name and metadata

❌ **What's NOT stored:**
- Private keys (always on device)
- PIN code
- Recovery phrase

🔒 **Transaction signing:**
- All signatures happen on the device
- You must physically approve each transaction
- Address and transaction details shown on device screen

## 💡 Common Workflows

### Creating and Deploying a Safe

```bash
# 1. Create a Safe (gets predicted address)
safe account create

# 2. Deploy it to the blockchain
safe account deploy eth:0x742d35Cc...
```

### Sending ETH from a Safe

```bash
# Create and sign a transaction
safe tx create
# → Select your Safe
# → Enter recipient address
# → Enter amount in wei
# → Sign it

# If you're the only signer needed, execute immediately
safe tx execute <txHash>

# Or, share the transaction with other signers (see Multi-sig section)
```

### Interacting with a Smart Contract

```bash
safe tx create
# → Select your Safe
# → Enter contract address

# The CLI automatically:
# ✓ Detects it's a contract
# ✓ Fetches the ABI from Etherscan/Sourcify
# ✓ Shows you all available functions
# ✓ Helps you fill in parameters with validation
# ✓ Encodes the transaction

# Then sign and execute as usual
```

### Multi-sig Coordination

**Option A: Using Safe Transaction Service** (Recommended)

```bash
# Owner 1: Create and push
safe tx create
safe tx sign <txHash>
safe tx push <txHash>

# Owner 2: Pull and sign
safe tx pull
safe tx sign <txHash>
safe tx push <txHash>

# Any owner: Execute when threshold is met
safe tx execute <txHash>
```

**Option B: Offline with JSON Export**

```bash
# Owner 1: Create and export
safe tx create
safe tx sign <txHash>
safe tx export <txHash>
# → Share the JSON with other owners

# Owner 2: Import and sign
safe tx import '{"safeTxHash":"0x..."...}'
safe tx sign <txHash>

# Check progress
safe tx status <txHash>  # Shows "2/3 signatures"

# Execute when ready
safe tx execute <txHash>
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Storage Location

Configuration files are stored in:
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.config/safe-cli/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\safe-cli\`

### Supported Networks (Default)

- Ethereum Mainnet
- Sepolia Testnet
- Polygon
- Arbitrum One
- Optimism
- Base
- Gnosis Chain
- BNB Smart Chain
- Avalanche C-Chain

Add custom networks with `safe config chains add`.

### Optional API Keys

These are optional but recommended for enhanced functionality:

#### Safe Transaction Service API Key

**Get it from:** [Safe Developer Dashboard](https://developer.safe.global)

**Enables:**
- Multi-sig coordination via Safe Transaction Service
- Push/pull transactions
- Integration with Safe web interface

**Without it:** You can still use offline JSON export/import for multi-sig.

#### Etherscan API Key

**Get it from:** [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/myapikey) (free)

**Enables:**
- Proxy contract detection (EIP-1967)
- Better ABI fetching for proxies
- Automatic ABI merging for proxy + implementation

**Without it:** Uses Sourcify as fallback (still works, but no proxy detection).

**Setup:** Run `safe config init` and follow the prompts, or edit the config file manually.

## 🔐 Security

### Private Key Wallets
- **Encryption**: Private keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **Key derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Local storage**: All data stored locally on your machine
- **No exposure**: Keys never logged or transmitted in plain text

### Hardware Wallets (Ledger)
- **Maximum security**: Private keys never leave the device
- **Physical confirmation**: All transactions require on-device approval
- **Industry standard**: BIP44 derivation paths
- **Secure Element**: Military-grade chip protection

**Recommendation**: Use Ledger hardware wallets for production Safe accounts with significant funds.
